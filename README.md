# Matt's DWM Install

This repo includes all of my suckless utils, including my DWM builds with all of the themes I've created. Instructions for install will come soon. If you choose to use them now, note that the patched version of DWM requires a .dwm directory in your $HOME directory. Mine is not included here yet, I will do that soon.
