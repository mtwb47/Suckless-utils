# This is old and no longer maintained. I have moved all of my things over to GitLab. https://gitlab.com/thelinuxcast/suckless-utils


This repo includes all of my suckless utils, including my DWM builds with all of the themes I've created. Instructions for install will come soon. If you choose to use them now, note that the patched version of DWM requires a .dwm directory in your $HOME directory. Mine is not included here yet, I will do that soon.

To change themes, change the first line of the config.def.h file before compile. Must be an absolute path. Theme folder is included inside dwm folder. Remember to change the username in the path!
